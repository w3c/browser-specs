/**
 * The find-specs script checks a number of spec sources to report new specs
 * that may be worth including in browser-specs.
 *
 * Command usage:
 * node src/find-specs.js --help
 *
 * Sources include WHATWG's database, TC39 proposals, and all known
 * repositories that W3C tracks in the w3c/validate-repos project.
 *
 * To avoid reporting specs more than once, the script looks at issues already
 * raised in w3c/browser-specs before it proposes a new one. The script won't
 * propose a spec whose URL or repository already appears in:
 * - open issues with a "new spec" label
 * - closed issues with an "ignore" label.
 *
 * Various functions take or produce a spec entry object. That's an object with
 * the following properties:
 * - `repo`: the name of the GitHub repository that contains the spec, owner
 * included. For example: "w3c/wot"
 * - `spec`: The URL of the spec. That URL is the /TR URL when one exists
 * (and when we manage to associate the repository with a /TR URL), the GitHub
 * homepage URL when one is defined, or a github.io URL derived from the name
 * of the repository.
 * - `nightly` (optional): The URL of the Editor's Draft when a /TR URL is
 * found. This allows to report specs in browser-specs whose canonical URL
 * needs to change because the underlying spec got published as FPWD.

Output:
  - The command reports a list of candidates for addition.
  - Additionally, if the \`--github\` option is set, the command also reports these candidates as issues opened against the \`w3c/browser-specs\` repository.

Notes:
  - The command only creates an issue if there is no open issue that already suggests adding the spec.

Examples:
  $ find-specs
  $ find-specs --github --max 3
